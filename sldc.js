//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 

const analysis = "Analysis is the step in which the developers define goals, objectives, and the functions of the thing they are building"

const design = "The step where development begins. Documentation and ideas are laid out here."

const implementation = "This step is where the implementation of the software in a production enviornment, making sure the system work for the defined user requirments"

const testingIntegration = "The step where testing and integrating code comes into play. Checks for errors, bugs, and other vulnerablilites in the code."

const maintain = "This step consists of maintaing your software by making any necessary updates to the software."
